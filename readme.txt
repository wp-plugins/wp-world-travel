== Description ==

Home Page: http://globetrooper.com/notes/wordpress-world-travel-plugin/

With WP World Travel, you can do the following:

* Display your Current Location to readers
* Display your Travel Schedule to readers
* Allow readers to propose Meetups in each location

The mantra of Globetrooper is to help people travel the world together. And the purpose of the WP World Travel 
plugin is the same. Of course, as a travel blogger, it also makes sense to display your travel plans and 
meetup with readers around the globe.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-world-travel.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Drag the widget into a sidebar through the 'Widgets' menu under 'Appearance' in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change my Current Location? =

In the WordPress dashboard you will find a menu for Schedule. That is where you can add your travel plans. The Current
Location is chosen from your future destinations. The plugin finds the location where the 'from' date is BEFORE today
and the 'to' date is AFTER today.

= How am I notified of proposed Meetups? =

All Meetups are recorded to WordPress so you can find them when you log into the Dashboard. You may also receive 
an email notification if your server is setup correctly. Also check you spam folders if you are not 
receiving the emails.
